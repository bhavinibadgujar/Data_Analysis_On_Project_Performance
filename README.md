Data Analysis on Product Performance

üìå Overview
This project analyzes the performance of multiple products across categories, brands, and sales channels.
Using Python and Data Analytics techniques, the goal is to derive insights on sales, revenue, discounts, customer ratings, and marketing effectiveness.

üìÇ Dataset

‚öôÔ∏è Responsibilities / Methodology
Data Preprocessing:
Checked data types, missing values, duplicates.
Outlier treatment using IQR method & capping.
Generated summary statistics.

Univariate Analysis:
Distribution of numerical variables (sales, revenue, ratings, profit margins).
Frequency counts of categorical variables (categories, brands, sales channels).

Bivariate Analysis:
Correlation analysis of numerical features.
Categorical vs numerical comparisons using bar plots.
Trends across peak sales periods & demographics.

Visualization:
Matplotlib & Seaborn used for plots: distribution plots, boxplots, bar charts.

Insights:
Electronics & Apparel are top-selling categories.
Discounts significantly impact revenue but lower profit margins.
Seasonal periods like Holiday Season & Black Friday boost sales.
Marketing spend has a measurable effect on promotion effectiveness.
